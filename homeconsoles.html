<div id="mordernc"><h2> Modern Home Console Gaming </h2></div>
<p> Over time, the technology behind video gaming consoles has improved. In earlier consoles, games were made of simple designs and only 2d worlds. While this was an amazing technological advancement for that time period, in today's current video game standards those games would not hold up. Current video game consoles are able to render 3d visuals and depict the worlds and art created by video game designers in high quality. The video games crafted by video game designers are built up of entire virtual worlds that the customer is able to explore to their heart's content. Modern gaming consoles such as the Playstation 4, the Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch show just how far video game technology had come. </p>
