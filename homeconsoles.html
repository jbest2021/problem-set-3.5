<div id="#intro2"><h2> Introduction </h2></div>

It was not until video game companies began to develop their own games to be bought and played. While the introduction of new video games helps expand the industry a decent amount, it wasn't until home video game consoles began being developed and sold to the public that the video game industry started to grow in popularity and wealth. The introduction of home console gaming got rid of the market for arcade gaming. Home console gaming allowed for people to stay in the comfort of their own homes while at the same time being able to enjoy the video games they loved so much and it was for these reasons that home console gaming took over the video game industry.</p>

<div id="mordernc"><h2> Modern Home Console Gaming </h2></div>
<p> Over time, the technology behind video gaming consoles has improved. In earlier consoles, games were made of simple designs and only 2d worlds. While this was an amazing technological advancement for that time period, in today's current video game standards those games would not hold up. Current video game consoles are able to render 3d visuals and depict the worlds and art created by video game designers in high quality. The video games crafted by video game designers are built up of entire virtual worlds that the customer is able to explore to their heart's content. Modern gaming consoles such as the Playstation 4, the Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch show just how far video game technology had come. </p>
